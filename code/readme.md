### Third party
Multi-way computations are based on MATLAB Tensor Toolbox Version 2.6
(Brett W. Bader, Tamara G. Kolda and others. MATLAB Tensor Toolbox Version 2.6, Available online, February 2015. URL: http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/). 
### Demonstrations:
We consider two way of constructing multi-way feature set: 2D and 3D (see slides in doc directory). Demos treat them separately.
* demo_2D_features, demo_3D_features_online - run QPFS or NQPFS for a single subject and 		evaluate linear regression quality for a range of features
* demo_prediction_across_subjects_2D, demo_prediction_across_subjects_3D - runs QPFS, NQPFS, PLS  and NPLS for all single subjects and evaluate regression quality for a several features
